					<p>The practice was set up in 1980 as John Simpson & Partners Ltd. Since 2012, the practice has traded as John Simpson Architects. It has worked on a wide variety of projects which include Public, Educational, Commercial and Residential buildings. It has also built up an expertise in dealing with large scale masterplans both within sensitive urban locations and on green field sites.</p>

			       <p>Its work revolves around the notion that Architecture is a public art where each and every building fa&ccedil;ade forms the character and shape of the public realm - the streets, the squares and the major civic spaces that we all use. As such it must use a language of building which is recognisable and by necessity, draws on our collective cultural experience - the inherited language of Architecture that each and everyone of us can relate to and understand.</p>

			       <p>Based in Bloomsbury in the centre of London the practice carries out projects across the world, in Britain, Europe and the USA. Its work ranges from the design of a major new university facility or an urban extension of a town to the design of an individual house or interior of a shop.</p>

			       <p>In general, the emphasis within the work of the practice is to create an architecture which is timeless: one that uses updated traditional forms to respond to contemporary requirements and modern technology. In this respect, the practice can claim a first for many of its buildings; for instance, the Galleries at Buckingham Palace opened in 2002 by HM Queen Elizabeth II, are the first of their type to incorporate the latest modern conservation technology for works of art within a design that is thoroughly traditional and classical.</p>

			       <p>At an urban design level, John Simpson Architects have also advocated a fresh new approach where technology is used to serve rather than dominate the design. Since 1990, with the masterplan for Fairford Leys at Aylesbury and later at Dicken's Heath in Solihull near Birmingham, the practice has shown how a sustainable urban alternative to the conventional suburban housing estate can work. Long before this became government policy in England, the practice pioneered the idea of mixed use settlements planned around streets and squares where day to day life is not reliant on the motor car. The practice now advises local authorities and its work features in government guidance on best practice in urban design.</p>

			      <p>The projects illustrated in this website are a selection from a range of work and are representative of the skill, expertise and knowledge that the practice has at its disposal. </p>

	        		<h2>Monograph</h2>
	        		<div class="monobox">
	        			<p>John Simpson is one of the leading architects in Europe and America who have returned in recent decades to the classical language of architecture, with all its richness, subtlety, and historic resonances.
						His public and private works show how this language lends itself with particular ease to the incorporation of the latest developments in technology. Describing a wide range of work from furniture design to town-planning, this beautifully illustrated book gives pride of place to his principal commission so far, the new Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace.</p>
	

   						<p>This major new centre for the visual arts in London was opened by Her Majesty The Queen in May 2002 as part of the celebrations of her Golden Jubilee. All in a sparklingly inventive and beautifully crafted classical language, the new additions include a Greek Doric entrance portico and entrance hall, with sculptured friezes and free-standing sculpture by Alexander Stoddart. A richly polychromatic staircase hall leads up to three large new galleries, a number of smaller galleries, and a lecture hall. Behind the scenes, Simpson has completely remodelled the Royal Kitchen, staff quarters, and Trades Yard.</p>

     				 	<p>John Simpson has also played a key role in the revival of traditional urbanism, as in his design for Paternoster Square next to St Paul's Cathedral, and, most recently in the ambitious Market Hall he has built at the Prince of Wales's new town of Poundbury, Dorset. Other chapters cover his interiors at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, a development inspired by the work of Soane and Cockerell, and Ashfold House, Sussex, which also takes Soanean themes in new directions.</p>

     				 	

      					<p>The authors are both well known architectural historians. Dr Richard John was a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford and is now at the Faculty of the School of Architecture in Miami. Professor David Watkin is a Fellow of Peterhouse and Professor of the History of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. He is also a leading authority on the work of C.R. Cockerell and Sir John Soane, architects who profoundly influenced John Simpson.  Interestingly, both John Simpson and David Watkin taught at the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture when Richard John was its Director.</p>



     		 			<p>The book is a unique and compelling demonstration of the fruitful interchange of history and practice in modern architecture.</p>
