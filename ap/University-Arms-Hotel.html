There were several objectives to transform the existing hotel: improving the relationship of the existing hotel to the street and to the Conservation Area, and making more efficient use of the hotel site in order to make the hotel more viable and meet the costs of the substantial improvements.  The aim was to refurbish the disparate buildings that the hotel currently comprises into a cohesively designed, landmark hotel that will give Cambridge the best in class hotel facilities with excellent new hotel rooms, a destination restaurant, bar, gym and conference facilities. </p>

							<p>The plans reference the history of this important hotel and seek to regenerate a key gateway to the city centre. The aim was to create something with timeless appeal; architecture that honours the traditions and creates an aura that is present in so much of the historic architecture in the city.  Best use has been made of the existing architecture, retaining features that give the hotel its historic character.  The new porte cochere, in particular, provides architectural ornament within the streetscape that contributes to the richness of the public realm whilst marking out the new entrance. </p>
