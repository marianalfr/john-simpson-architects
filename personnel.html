					<p> Extract from entry in Dictionary of Architecture, Compiled by Professor James Stevens Curl, Oxford University Press.</p>

					<p>“English architect.  Having rejected International Modernism he sought to show how the classical language of architecture could be used in contemporary economic, technical and functional requirements.  His work is derived largely from Georgian sources and he made his name with Ashfold House in West Sussex (1991), influenced by Soane's architecture.</p>

					<p>Simpson had considerable influence in making the public aware of the New Classicism in the 1980s, especially with the exhibition Real Architecture at the Building Centre, London (1988).  His works at Gonville and Caius College, at the University of Cambridge (1994-98), have added lustre to his reputation.  In 2000, his Market Building, the first public building at the Prince of Wales's Development in Poundbury, was completed.  In 1999 his firm won the competition to redevelop the Queen's Galleries and Royal Kitchens at Buckingham Palace, London which was completed in time for the opening of The Queen's Golden Jubilee Celebration in 2002.  Since then the practice has been commissioned to carry out work in the USA and has worked on two buildings on the upper East side of Manhattan on 5th Avenue in New York.  The first, completed in 2005, has been described by the Landmarks Commission of New York as the first Traditionally Classical Building to be built in the city since the 1960's and for which he was awarded the Palladio prize in 2007." </p>

					

					<p>John Simpson has been eminent in the urban design field, first coming to prominence with his design for Paternoster Square in the City of London in the early 1990's. Since then, he has become the masterplanner for several new mixed-use urban extensions in England, such as Fairford Leys in Aylesbury for the Ernest Cook Trust. He was the adviser to Solihull Metropolitan Council for the new village at Dickens Heath, completed in 2010.  He prepared the masterplan for Newcastle Great Park in Newcastle Upon Tyne and the new mixed-use urban extension to Swindon, known as the Swindon Southern Development Area, completed in 2008.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>John Simpson pioneered mixed-use sustainable urban design long before it was adopted as government policy in the UK and his work appears within government best practice guidance documentation such as “Places, Streets and Movement”. He also pioneered the idea of design codes for establishing quality in design, which he first applied at Fairford Leys in Aylesbury, and has worked as part of the pilot study for Design Codes run for The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE).</p>

					<p>In 2004, he won the competition to design a masterplan and new buildings for Peterhouse, the oldest college at the University of Cambridge, and in 2005, he won a similar competition for his masterplan design proposals for new graduate and undergraduate facilities at Lady Margaret Hall at the University of Oxford.</p>
			
					<p>In 2008 he was given the Arthur Ross Award by the Institute of Classical Architecture in New York.</p>

					<p>More recently he has worked on the new public facilities at Kensington Palace, which were opened for Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the new quadrangle at Eton College and the new Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre. John is particularly skilled at arranging spaces to maximise their efficiency and to make them enjoyable to use.</p>

					<p>In 2014 John Simpson won the competition to design the new School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame, the world’s leading institution teaching architects in the Classical tradition.</p>

					<p>Much of his work has involved working with new buildings designed within sensitive historic settings and with Listed buildings in conservation areas. Many of these buildings are Grade I Listed.</p>

					<ul>

					<p>The following awards have been accumulated over recent years:</p>
						<li>Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Award for Building Conservation 2013</li>
						<li>Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Award for a building providing a major Community Benefit 2013</li>
